<h3> - Scratch:</h3>
<p>
  One of the first things I was recommended to do was to play around with Scratch
  for a few hours. It's a website made for kids, where you animate charaters on screen
  by giving them very explicit, code like instructions. It's less about learning
  to code as it is about teaching algorhythmic thinking, but it's good fun. For a while anyway.</p>
