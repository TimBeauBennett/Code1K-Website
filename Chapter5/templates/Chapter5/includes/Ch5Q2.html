<h3> - Question 2:</h3>
<h4>What is the value of the expression 2 * 3 + 4 in Python?</h4>
<p> - My Answer: 10. Because multiplication is higher than addition in order of
  operations.</p>
<p> - Mark's Answer: The value will be 10, the result of 6 + 4. Python's operator
  precedence rules are applied in the absence of parentheses, and multiplication
  has higher precedence than (ie it happens before) addition.</p>
