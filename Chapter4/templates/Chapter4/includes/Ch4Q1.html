<h4>Name four of Pythonâ€™s core data types.</h4>
<p> - My Answer: Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries.</p>
<p> - Mark's Answer: Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, files, and
  sets are generally considered to be the core object (data) types. Types, None,
  and Booleans are sometimes classified this way as well. There are multiple
  number types (integer, floating point, complex, fraction and decimal) and
  multiple string types (simple strings and Unicode strings in Python 2.X, and
  test strings and byte strings in Python 3.X).</p>
