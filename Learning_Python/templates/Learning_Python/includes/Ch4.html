<h3>Chapter 4 - Intro to Python Types</h3>

  <h4>1: Name four of Pythonâ€™s core data types.</h4>
    <p> - My Answer: Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries.</p>
    <p> - Mark's Answer: Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, files, and
      sets are generally considered to be the core object (data) types. Types, None,
      and Booleans are sometimes classified this way as well. There are multiple
      number types (integer, floating point, complex, fraction and decimal) and
      multiple string types (simple strings and Unicode strings in Python 2.X, and
      test strings and byte strings in Python 3.X).</p>

  <h4>2: Why are they called 'core' data types?</h4>
    <p> - My Answer: These objects are the data type included with Python. Technically
      a user can build any kind of data type or object in a class, but even then
      these basic data types are the building blocks of more complex objects. Also
      they're generally build better, because your code probably suck. I know mine does.</p>
    <p> - Mark's Answer: They are known as "core" types because they are part of
      Python language itself and are always available; to create ther objects you
      generally must call functions in impored modules. Most of the core types have
      specific syntax for generating the objects. 'spam', for example, is an
      expression that makes a string and determines the set of perations that can
      be applied to it. Because of thiss, core tes are hardwired into Python's
      syntax. In contrast, you must call the built in open function to create a
      file object.</p>

  <h4>3: What does "immutable" mean, and which three of Python's core types are considered immutable?</h4>
    <p> - My Answer: Immutable just means that an object cannot be altered in place.
      It can be operated on, and the changed version of the object returned as a
      function's output, and returned to a variable, but the object itself persists,
      unless the variable is overwritten. Strings, Tuples and sets (???) are immutable. </p>
    <p> - Mark's Answer: An immutable object is an object that cannot be changed
      after it is created. Numbers, strings and tuples in Python fall into this
      categoy. While you cannot change an immtable obect in-place you can always
      make a new one by running an expression. </p>

  <h4>4: What does 'sequence' mean, and which three types fall into that category?</h4>
    <p> - My Answer: A sequence is an objec that consists of ordered and indexed items.
      The three cores types that are sequences are lists, strings and tuples. Yeah. </p>
    <p> - Mark's Answer: A sequence is a positionally ordered collection of objexts.
      Strings lists and tuples are all sequences in Python. They share comon sequence
      operations, such as indexing, cancatenation, and slicing, but also have
      type-specific method calls. </p>

  <h4>5: What does "maping" mean, and which core type is a mapping?</h4>
    <p> - My Answer: A mapping is an object type that associates one variable to
      another for later retrieval. The dictionary is a mapping object. </p>
    <p> - Mark's Answer: The term "mapping" denotes an object that maps keys
      to assicaiated vlues. Python's dictionary is the only mapping type in
      the cre type set. Mappings do not maintain any left-to-right positional
      ordering; they support access to data stored by key, plus type-specific
      method calls. </p>

  <h4>6: What is 'polymorphism' and why do you care?</h4>
    <p> - My Answer: It's Python's ability to have an operation have a different
      affect on different object types, eg + is addition for numbers and concatenation
      for strings. I care because I need to know them otherwise I'll start breaking
      things, but also it's why python is powerful and flexible, and it's smart
      because it knows what kind of objects things are an acts accordingly. </p>
    <p> - Mark's Answer: "Polymorphism" meands that th meaning of an operation (like
      a +) depend on the objects being operated on. This turns out to be a key idea
      (perhaps the key idea) behind using Python well - not constraining code to
      specific types makes that code automatically applicable to many tyes. </p>
